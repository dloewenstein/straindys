\title{Find time to true strain peaks using percentage criteria for circumferential/longitudinal strain}
\usage{
timePeakStrain(x, strain, thresh, incr, position.firstStrainColumn)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{dataframe containing the strain columns in a long format.}

\item{strain}{the strain variable you want to mutate, written inside "".}

\item{thresh}{percentage of the peak strain value that a valley has to reach to be
considered a true valley.}

\item{incr}{percentage of the peak strain value by which the strain increase between valley and the
following peak has to reach.}

\item{position.firstStrainColumn}{the index position for the first strain segment in the dataframe}
}
\value{
A dataframe with id and a straincolumn containing the time for the first peak
fulfilling the criteria
}
